            I have ever come across and I feel so grateful and happy that she is in my life as an acupuncturist,
            healer and friend. After a decade of <strong>hormonal skin troubles</strong> Hye-Eun evened out my hormonal cycle in
            under 2 months and every day, with the help of a nutritionist, my skin is getting better, healthier and
            stronger under her care. Hye-Eun asks all the right questions, shows a keen interest, genuinely cares
            and takes time to talk to and know her clients, therefore providing a fine tuned and thorough treatment
            every single time. It's like time stops when I'm with her and I feel like I've known her a life time.
            She has practiced in her field for over twenty years and her experience is second to none.
            She is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable about all aspects of the human body and there isn’t a
            question I wouldn’t ask her about nearly anything. She dedicates her life to her work and clients and it shows. <br />
            I have recommended her to everyone I know verbally and I now know why people believe in magic.
            Thank you Hye-Eun for absolutely everything, you one in a million star on earth."

            It wasn't as scary as I thought thanks to Hye-Eun's caring, professional approach. Not only have I had a

I had known of Hye-Eun through a friend who had helped her with back problems. I made the appointment and have never looked back. I no longer suffer with high colour, spots are a thing of the past and acupuncture has helped in many other ways. Treating the whole body creates better wellbeing. Even to lessening <strong>veins in my legs</strong>, the result of having to stand for several hours each day. Hye-Eun is also treating me for <strong>dry-eye</strong>. The
            result is amazing, far less soreness and irritation. I am only using eye drops occasionally.
            Hye-Eun is a pleasure to visit on each and every appointment. I think she is wonderful."

Hye-Eun had been recommended to me by another acupuncturist, and from her first treatment my symptoms began to improve and have continued to do so.

A friend recommended Hye-Eun and her caring impeccable professionalism made a great deal of difference to me during difficult months. I cannot imagine a better acupuncturist. The needles, which I feared initially, seemed to glide in so smoothly under her skilled hands, that the experience was not at all uncomfortable. Meanwhile the depth of the questions she asked and the real sense I got of her care for my painful body gave me great solace in another, valuable way. Week by wek I improved, and though one can never know for certain, I am pretty convinced that the acupuncture was invaluable and hastened my recovery. Thank you Hye-Eun."
