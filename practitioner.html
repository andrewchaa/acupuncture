							<p>Hye-Eun was born and brought up in Korea, where the practice of Chinese Medicine is deeply rooted in daily life. She is a graduate in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine from the College of Integrated Chinese Medicine (CICM) in Reading, and has been practising in Brighton, Hove and Lewes, East Sussex, over the past fourteen years and is now offering her treatments in Harley Street in London. Before Hye-Eun embarked on the journey of Chinese medicine, she studied first Biology and then English Language & Literature at Kyung-Hee University, Seoul. She also completed her first year in Nursing in Korea University, one of the top three prestigious univerisities in Korea, Seoul before moving to the UK.</p>

        <p>Since Hye-Eun graduated from her five year Chinese Medicine studies at CICM, she has dedicated herself to continuous professional development as well as running her acupuncture practices from very well established clinics in Lewes, Hove and Harley Street in London. Hye-Eun is a highly experienced acupuncturist and carries out around 2,500 acupuncture treatments per year. During her years of practice, Hye-Eun has completed various postgraduate trainings, including fertility, IVF/IUI and pregnancy support, including the studies with professor Yuning Wu, one of the most eminent fertility specialists and gynaecologists at the Beijing Hospital in China. Hye-Eun works closely with patients undergoing IVF/ ICSI / IUI treatments including donor eggs/ donor sperms, especially at the clinics of The Agora Fertility Clinic (Hove), Esperance Clinic (Eastbourne) and The Bridge Centre (London) and is familiar with the protocols of these clinics. She also worked in the Gateway Clinic in Lambeth hospital, London, for three years, where she gained valuable experience in the treatment of pain mangement and cancer support. She is currently participating in a support group in London, run by Andrew Flower, one of the UK's most respected Chinese herbal practitioners, as part of her continuous professional development.</p>
        <p>Hye-Eun is a very ‘hands on’ person, who is good at building rapport and gaining trust. She offers tailored treatments for a wide range of conditions. Her treatment style is a pragmatic mix of Five Elements and TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), always within the context of a holistic approach. Running a busy clinic means needing to be very efficient, not only in being able to make prompt and accurate diagnoses and treatment plans, but also being at the top of ones skills at all times. Hye-Eun is a Regional Group Tutor for CICM students in Brighton and is on the clinical observation practitioners’ list at CICM, and she finds sharing her enthusiam and her understanding of the learning processs with students highly rewarding, even though they are at the beginning of their studies.</p>
        <p>Hye-Eun is a member of the British Acupuncture Council and Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine.</p>
