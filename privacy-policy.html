        <p>The processing of personal data is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the GDPR). This legislation will replace current data privacy law, giving more rights to you as an individual and more obligations to organisations holding your personal data.</p>
        <p>One of the rights is a right to be informed, which means we have to give you even more information than we do now about the way in which we use, share and store your personal information.</p>
        <p>This means that we will be publishing a new privacy notice so you can access this information, along with information about the increased rights you have in relation to the information we hold on you and the legal basis on which we are using it.</p>
        <p>This new privacy notice comes into effect and will be published on our website on <strong>25 May 2018</strong>.</p>

            <strong>Section 16 applies to those who complain about our services</strong>
        </p>
        <ol start="16">
            <li>When we receive a complaint from a person we make up a file containing the details of the complaint. This normally contains
                the identity of the complainant and any other individuals involved in the complaint.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We will only use the personal information we collect to process the complaint and to check on the level of service we provide.
            We usually have to disclose the complainant’s identity to whoever the complaint is about. If a complainant doesn’t want
            information identifying him or her to be disclosed, we will try to respect that. However, it may not be possible to handle
            a complaint on an anonymous basis. We may need to provide personal information collected and processed in relation to
            complaints to the British Acupuncture Council or our insurance company.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We will keep personal information contained in paper complaint files in line with our retention policy, which will be stored
            in our locked filing cabinet at the clinic. This means that information relating to a complaint will be retained for
            two years from closure. It will be retained in a secure environment and access to it will be restricted according to
            the ‘need to know’ principle</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Similarly, where enquiries are submitted to us we will only use the information supplied to us to deal with the enquiry and
            any subsequent issues and to check on the level of service we provide.</p>
