					<p><em>"I am still not sure how to pronounce this super talented therapist's name, but I can assure you that I know how to appreciate her intelligent and empathetic nature - not to mention her superb skills. My baby was still breech in week 36 and suddenly realizing that this means a planned caesarian in the UK (unlike in Denmark where I am from) I totally panicked, however by chance of luck I walked past the clinic and received a treatment from Hye-Eun. Our beautiful baby turned that very night, and both me and my husband are deeply grateful. Hye-Eun has a way of oozing that she has all the time in the world for you and she really really listens. Not just with her ears, but with all her astute senses. I can highly recommend her"</em></p>

        <h3>Pre-birth treatment</h3>

					<p><em>"After my acupuncture yesterday, I went to hospital for monitoring. The doctors wanted to keep me in and induce me on a drip because of infection risk which would have meant even a waterbirth would be impossible. But luckily (and I think it's mostly thanks to you) my contractions got started while I was in hospital, so they gave me 2 hours grace at home to make progress in my labour, otherwise I'd have no choice but induction. The contractions increased at home and a beautiful little boy was born this morning at 2.43am in my birthing pool. Safely and serenely at home relaxed to music and candle light with my loving boyfriend and some gas and air, all just as I dreamed. Thank you so much for your attention"</em></p>

        <p>Acupuncture treatment is given once a week, from 37 or 38 weeks until delivery. Acupuncture can be used in two main ways in the later stages of pregnancy. Firstly, it can help prepare a womanâ€™s body for birth, with an emphasis on preparing the cervix and pelvis for labour. Secondly, treatments can be given to deal with discomforts that women may experience around this time, which are often considered to be normal, including heartburn, constipation, varicose veins, backache, swelling of hands & feet, difficulty in sleeping and increased anxiety and tiredness.</p>
        <p>Midwives, who regularly use pre-birth acupuncture for their patients, have observed a trend in women who have received pre-birth acupuncture, to either go into spontaneous labour around their due dates, or, if an induction is required, to respond well to induction and to progress efficiently to a natural birth.</p>
