        <p>Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is one of the most sophisticated herbal medicine systems in the world. Although CHM is relatively unknown in the West, compared to acupuncture, it is, in fact, regarded as the main part of the Chinese medicine and practised extensively in clinics and hospitals throughout China and Korea, alongside Western medicine.</p>
        <p>Like acupuncture, CHM assesses and treats each person as a unique individual rather than being based entirely on a disease or its symptoms. Healing with CHM is based on the restoration of harmony and balance within the body.</p>
        <p>Considerable research into many aspects of CHM has been conducted in China and the West, proving its efficacy and merit.</p>

        <h3>What happens in the treatment?</h3>
        <p>In my practice, Chinese herbs are normally prescribed alongside acupuncture, within a given session.</p>
        <p>After a thorough diagnosis, each person is prescribed an individual formula (typically 10-15 ingredients) correlating to that individu al's pattern of internal disharmony.</p>
