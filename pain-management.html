        <p>Increasing numbers of people come for acupuncture treatment for painful conditions. Often, people have heard about the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating headaches, back pain or sciatic pain. In addition to these, there are many other painful conditions, including musculo-skeletal problems, that can be treated very effectively.</p>
        <p>Acupuncture is excellent for promoting the circulation of blood and Qi (vital force) to the local area of the problem, which increases the natural healing power of the body. Clinical research shows that inserting acupuncture needles triggers the production of endorphins, natural pain relievers. 1 In another study, higher levels of endorphins were found in cerebrospinal fluid after patients had undergone acupuncture. 2/3</p>
